### #CodeRedChallenge #100DaysOfCode

Recently I was approved for my application for Github sponsorship.

```
No, I'm not asking you to sponsor me.
I'm asking you to make me and a few others to CRY, 
by participating in the spiciest coding competition.

## What is the #CodeRedChallenge ?
The objective of the #CodeRedChallenge is to people how to code in a fun and entertaining way by using a game show formate like **Hot Ones** as a form of active engagement for educational purposes.

### Active Engagement
1. Think Pair Share
2. Tweet your explanation  

### Origin of this challenge.
Last year I taught coding to high school students in CTE public school. One thing I focused heavily on was bringing industry into the classroom via guest speakers from companies such as Infusionsoft/Keap, Carvana, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Auth0 and many others.

After inviting [Millan Singh](), to the classroom, he invited me over to his podcast [SpyFy After Dark](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2QsnQnikPpYk7oeedeWLCg). He then filmed the episode, [The future of technical education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk21KGMpwo&t=1s). After the show I was talking about doing a live coding event and [Alex]() coined the term, Code Red, which is where we get the hashtag for the event.

[![SpyFy After Dark: The future of technical education](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5007073/88072853-631aff00-cb2a-11ea-874d-b4e288888350.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk21KGMpwo&t=1s)

Originally, after leaving my teaching position, I was taking care of my son full time and talking with Millan and a few others about setting up a coding workshops/bootcamp but COVID made those plans fall through. As a result, I focused on writing on medium with the goal of turning them into a book. I also occasionally [mentor people 1:1](https://www.codementor.io/@hansdev). 



### Challenges
Each step will begin with a progressively hotter hot sauce.

     * Students will then be **evaluated on their knowledge** (quiz).

## A Brief History of JavaScript & Node.js
Originally, websites did not have the any interactive behavior and were essentially just displaying text files. Eventually HTML and HTTP and other related technologies changed this. The creators behind the Mosaic browser, created a language called “LiveScript” and shipped it in 1995 to address this need. Within 3 months, it was renamed to “JavaScript” to build on the hype train programmers were on for Java, a completely separate and unrelated language.
