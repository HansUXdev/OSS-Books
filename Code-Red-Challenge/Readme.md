## What is the #CodeRedChallenge ?
The objective of the #CodeRedChallenge is to teach people how to code in a fun and entertaining way by using a game show formate like **Hot Ones** as a form of active engagement for educational purposes.

### Active Engagement
1. Think Pair Share
2. Tweet your explanation  

### Origin of this challenge.
Last year I taught coding to high school students in CTE public school. One thing I focused heavily on was bringing industry into the classroom via guest speakers from companies such as Infusionsoft/Keap, Carvana, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Auth0 and many others.

After inviting [Millan Singh](), to the classroom, he invited me over to his podcast [SpyFy After Dark](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2QsnQnikPpYk7oeedeWLCg). He then filmed the episode, [The future of technical education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk21KGMpwo&t=1s). After the show I was talking about doing a live coding event and [Alex]() coined the term, Code Red, which is where we get the hashtag for the event.

[![SpyFy After Dark: The future of technical education](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5007073/88072853-631aff00-cb2a-11ea-874d-b4e288888350.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk21KGMpwo&t=1s)

Originally, after leaving my teaching position, I was taking care of my son full time and talking with Millan and a few others about setting up a coding workshops/bootcamp but COVID made those plans fall through. As a result, I focused on writing on medium with the goal of turning them into a book. I also occasionally [mentor people 1:1](https://www.codementor.io/@hansdev).
