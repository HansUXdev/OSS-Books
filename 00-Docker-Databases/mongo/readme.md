# Package.json is used to demostrate NPM Scripts for use with docker
Students should be able to:
* Identify the following line in the package.json file
```
"mongo": "docker exec -it learn-mongo mongo",
```
* Distinguish between the name of the docker image (mongo) and the container name (learn-mongo)

# Demonstrate Mongo Terminal Commands
1. Running with docker compose
     - ```docker exec -it learn-mongo mongo```


# What did you build
Today we'll be learning how to use Docker Compose to learn MongoDB.
