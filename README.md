# OSS BOOK(S)
Open Source Book(s) is a long term project with the following objectives:
1. Create & Maintain open source curriculum designed to teach anyone 16+ how to use JavaScript as the primary langauge to build a web site (JSX & JSS), server, mobile app or hardware device (J5).
2. Promote content via social media, events and invite contributors and ðŸ¤ž supporters.
3. Sell Content to (For-Profit) Educational Institutions --> Profit --> Donate 4G Computers to underprivilaged kids.

# Note
I've never written a book before so any and all feedback or contributions are highly appreciated.
I'll even welcome trolls at this point (regret it later)...
If you like one and want to contribute there are a bunch of ways you can help. Some Examples:
* Writing an article on it, 
* making a fancy slideshow, 
* or an assessment quiz (for technical interviews)


## Content Creation
I have 4 main subjects I want to cover in the following order.
1. JavaScript Runtime (Node.js) -->Terminal Commands, NVM & Git -->JavaScript Fundemental-->Node Website-->Functional/OOP Programming 
   - The idea here is to make learning CS without the low level garbage that drives people away, while still teaching programming concepts and concludes with a simple website built entirely with javascript and no frameworks...
2. JavaScript Hardware (JohnnyFive) --> J5 --> ... (NEED THE MOST HELP HERE)
   - The idea 
2. JavaScript Web Site --> Concepts & Hosting Stuff --> -->HTML --> CSS --> SCSS--> JSX --> JSS --> React, 
   - The idea here is to teach enough HTML, CSS to appreate it but not enough to specialize in it so much that cant do Server-side stuff.
4. JavaScript Mobile Apps --> TypeScript --> Deno --> React Ionic --> React-Native
   - The idea 

Check out the [project boards](https://github.com/HansUXdev/OSS-Books/projects) to get a better idea of the scope of topics I want to cover. The [Medium Distribution](https://github.com/HansUXdev/OSS-Books/projects/5) is an outline to help me keep track of articles, I will personally publish. The other boards are used for
