Open Source Book(s) is a long term project with the following objectives:
1. Create & Maintain open source curriculum designed to teach anyone 16+ how to use JavaScript as the primary language to build a web site (JSX & JSS), server, mobile app or hardware device (J5).
2. Promote content via social media, events and invite contributors and ðŸ¤ž supporters.
3. Sell Content to (For-Profit) Educational Institutions --> Profit --> Donate 4G Computers to underprivileged kids.

# Note
I've never written a book before so any and all feedback or contributions are highly appreciated.
I'll even welcome trolls at this point (regret it later)...
If you like one and want to contribute there are a bunch of ways you can help. Some Examples:
* Writing an article on it, 
* making a fancy slideshow, 
* or an assessment quiz (for technical interviews)


## Content Creation
I have 4 broad subjects I want to cover .
1. JavaScript Runtime 
   - Scope: Node.js -->Terminal Commands, NVM & Git -->JavaScript Fundemental-->Node Website-->Functional & OOP Programming 
   - The idea here is to teach CS without the low level garbage that drives people away from it and without the oversimplified HTML/CSS first approach. JavaScript is a good middle ground because its a dynamic language and you can still teach programming concepts as well as web design.
2. JavaScript Web Site 
   - Scope: Concepts & Hosting Stuff -->HTML --> CSS --> SCSS--> JSX --> JSS --> React, 
   - The idea here is to teach enough HTML, CSS to appreciate it but not enough to specialize in just the design aspect and instead focusing on  Server-side stuff and component-based design.
3. JavaScript Mobile Apps
   - Scope: TypeScript --> Deno --> React Ionic --> React-Native
   - The idea here is to teach TypeScript and more OOP standards using app development so the transition into C#, Java, etc is easier in college.
4. JavaScript Hardware 
  - Scope: (JohnnyFive) --> J5 --> 3D Printing, ____ (NEED THE MOST HELP HERE)
   - The idea is use JavaScript to teach some basic electrical engineering concepts and cater more to kinesthetic learners.
   - 
Check out the [project boards](https://github.com/HansUXdev/OSS-Books/projects) to get a better idea of the scope of topics I want to cover. The [Medium Distribution](https://github.com/HansUXdev/OSS-Books/projects/5) is an outline to help me keep track of articles, I will personally publish. The other boards are used for
